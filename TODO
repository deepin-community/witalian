witalian TODO --- list of things to be done.  19 Feb 1998.


Everyone is welcome to help getting some or all of these things done!
Please contact Davide G. M. Salvetti <salve@debian.org> if you can
contribute.


- Carefully check the words in the dictionary to fix typos or mispelled
  ones.  Words not in italian.unchecked are supposed to be correct.


- Split words in italian.unchecked according to the following rules:

	Acronym and the like		     -> italian.sigle
	Italian surnames		     -> italian.cognomi
	Italian names (people and places)    -> italian.nomi
	Italian common words		     -> italian.parole
	Foreign(*) surnames		     -> italian.surnames
	Foreign(*) names (people and places) -> italian.names
	Foreign(*) common words		     -> italian.words
	Other words(*)			     -> italian.others

  (*): Obviously these words have to be of common use among Italian
  speaking people.
