Installation instructions.


If you are a happy Debian GNU/Linux user, please ignore all of the
following instructions except this very one: you can build and install this
dictionary using debian/rules; for example type:

	debian/rules binary

to build a .deb package in the parent of the source directory (you have to
be root for that to work); then you can install that with `dpkg --install'
as usual.  (Of course you can also find a precompiled binary version on
ftp.debian.org and its mirrors.)


If you are not a Debian GNU/Linux user, please read on.


1.  To build the dictionary type:

	make


2.  To install the dictionary and its man page type:

	make install

    This will install the files under /usr/local; if you wish to install
    them in some other location (e.g. /usr) type something like this,
    instead:

	make prefix=/usr install


3.  You may wish to compress the installed man page, since it is not done
    by default.


4.  You can clean the source directory, if you wish:

	make clean
